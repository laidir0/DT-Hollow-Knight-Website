            There are different systems that while all have the core aspects of TTRPG's, slightly dereive in terms of
            the ruleset, mechanics, and avaliable creation choices. Whilst this page will not list every single one that
            exists, it will show the more common ones, as well as more niche ones I have experienced.

        <h3>Dungeons and Dragons</h3>

            Whenever someone mentions TTRPG's, this playing system will most typically be the one that springs to mind.
            Being the most commonly encountered and easiest accessible for new players, this too was my first system I
            had played in. Having editions that date back to 1974, Dungeons and Dragons is most recently publicized on
            its revised 5th edition.

            As a completely new player to TTRPGs back in 2022, it was very daunting to look at a system and have zero
            idea where to begin. But thanks to DnD's own built app, avaliable on desktop and mobile,
            <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">DnD Beyond</a>, it comes with the basic essentials you will need to
            digitally create a character. With easily explained mechanics and descriptions, it allows newer players to
            the scene to dip their toes into the water and get a feel of the overall vibe, much like myself. Highly
            reccommend to check out if you are a new player trying to play TTRPG's for the first time.
