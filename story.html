            <h1 class="main-title">The gravitating tale of Hallownest</h1>

            <p>
                Before Hallownest existed, the land was split between tribes of insectoid and arachnoid beings: the
                moths who worshipped The Radiance, plant-like beings in Greenpath who worshipped Unn, the mantises, the
                mushrooms, the spiders and so forth. Then a higher being known as the Wyrm traveled to the land of
                Kingdom's Edge and metamorphosed into the Pale King.
            </p>

            <p>
                He lowered himself to appear like the bugs that inhabited the land, and built up the kingdom of
                Hallownest, granting the beings free will and sapience. He also sought to expand his kingdom to
                encompass all of the nearby lands and tribes. The mysterious King's good deeds and godly nature were
                admirable to most creatures of Hallownest, and the bugs began to follow him, surrendering their archaic
                religious beliefs. Among them were the Moths, who abandoned their old deity, the Radiance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Radiance, becoming malevolent after being forgotten, began to appear in the dreams of the bugs of
                Hallownest in an attempt to re-establish its following. These visions caused the bugs to become
                mindless, violent, zombie-like undead beings, suffering eternally. The Radiance's plague became known as
                the Infection.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to try and combat this, the Pale King begun to experiment with a substance known as the Void to
                create a pure vessel that he could seal the Radiance within for good, and keep his kingdom from falling
                to madness.
            </p>

            <p>
                This resulted in thousands of vessels being create, and eventually the Pale King chose the purest one
                and dubbed them the "Hollow Knight". The King would use the Hollow Knight as a tool to seal the Radiance
                inside them, and lock the vessel inside a vault named the Black Egg.
            </p>
            <p>
                This only worked for a time. The Radiance slowly began to leak out and infect the kingdom of Hallownest
                once more. The Hollow Knight's shell begun to crack due to one core fault: emotional attachment to its
                creator, the father that trained them. The Pale King only saw one solution; to seal this away for good.
            </p>

            <p>
                Through the appointment of three bugs, named the Dreamers, was the seal placed on the Hollow Knight.
                Though this would not stop the eventual downfall of Hallownest, and eventually the Pale King and his
                court would mysteriously vanish whilst his kingdom was left to rot.
            </p>

            <p>
                And so the story of the game begins, and as the player, you must discover how this all came to be, and
                venture forth to answer the mysteries tied to your own past. Everything you find is there for a reason,
                which makes the world of Hallownest all the more enchanting and intriguing. I find aimleslly exploring
                to be so enjoyable in this game, as I find myself with so many questions and theories.
