                    "In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret, For none could tame our savage
                    souls yet you the challenge met, Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were
                    redeemed, A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed." - From 'Elegy for Hallownest
                    by Monomon the Teacher'

                A 2D metoidvania with an emphasis on close combat and exploration in which the player enters the once
                prosperous now bleak insect kingdom of Hallownest, travels through its various districts, meets friendly
                inhabitatnts, fights hostile enemies plagued by a once sealed infection and uncovers the kingdom's
                history whilst improving their combat abilities and movement by defeating bosses and unlocking hidden
                areas.

                This is a game I orignally fell in love with, left for years as most gamers do, but manged to come back
                to it after the release of Silksong. And I found myself obsessed with how Team Cherry manages to make
                everything feel so alive whilst you explore a desolate kingdom.

                My website will cover my overall review of the game and most importantly, trying to get you to play it!
                It truly deserves all the recognition and support it has received.
