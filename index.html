        <h1>Through its sacrifice, Hallownest lasts eternal</h1>

        <p>
            "In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret, For none could tame our savage souls yet
            you the challenge met, Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed, A world you
            gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed."" - From 'Elegy for Hallownest by Monomon the Teacher'
        </p>
