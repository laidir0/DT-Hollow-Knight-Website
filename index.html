        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

        <p>
            TTRPG's, abbreviated from Table Top Roleplaying Games, stem all the way back to the early 1970's, when
            Dungeons and Dragons was first introduced. At their core, you sit around a table and are guided by a Game
            Master who defines the world and its narrative. You, as the player, create a character to fit into this
            world and change the world presented before you as well as its story. The sky is the limit when it comes to the option of choice, and that for
            me is the charm that will never be lost within its storytelling and gameplay.

        <p>
            I've been playing TTRPG's for 3 years now, and along that time I have created several characters and played
            in a handful of systems. Here you will find a beginner's introduction to TTRPG's as a whole, as well as the
            enjoyment I've experienced over the years.
