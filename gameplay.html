            <p>
                Hollow Knight's gameplay revolves around one main aspect: exporlation. Initally, you're not explicity
                told where to go. Dawned with an abandoned kingdom, you explore and uncover its secrets. As you descend
                deeper, you discover new areas, fight difficult enemies, interact with NPCs, and gain new abilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                The areas that divide Hallownest are vast and all connect to each other in their own way. Such as the
                Blue Lake being the reason that the City of Tears is in a constant state of rainfall. All these areas
                provide a different aspect of gaming, with their obstacles, environments and enemies. For example, in
                the Mantis Village, you must gain the respect of the mantis tribe by battling through their ranks and
                eventually taking on the three Mantis Lords. Afterwards, they bow to you due to your combat prowess and
                do not attack unless challenged.

                In terms of combat, you have two main forms of attacking; your nail, and the spells your Soul provides.
                The nail is a basic weapon used within Hallownest that can be upgraded by an old weaponsmith residing in
                the western side of the City of Tears. There are three core spells that you can obtain. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vengeful Spirit - A quick burst attack that shots horizontally across the screen.</li>
                <li>Desolate Dive - A slam down that damages all nearby enemies and obstacles.</li>
                <li>
                    Howling Wraiths - A sudden shout that sprawls upwards, mainly used against enemies that fly around
                    the screen.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these provide their own unique spin on an already simple combat system, allowing the player to
                utilise these spells in specific scenarios where they shine the most.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hollow Knight also has a system known as Charms; equipabble badges that the player can wear dependent on
                how many notches they have which all provide their own status effect. Charms reward the player as they
                can be found by progressing questlines or simply exploring areas and finding them in hidden pathways.
            </p>

            <p>
                I find the gameplay and combat of Hollow Knight to be super unique. After getting upgraded movement
                through the Mothwing Dash and the Mantis Claw, navigating through areas feels fresh and like it rewards
                you for well timed and skilled movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                The game is suited more towards people looking for a dificult challenge. From the bosses, areas
                requiring precise timing on parkour, to boss rush challenges known as the Pantheons.
